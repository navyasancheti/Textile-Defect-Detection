<h1 align="center"> Textile Defect Detection</h1> <br>
 
## Introduction:
Fabric defect detection is a necessary and essential step of quality control in the textile manufacturing industry. It is the determination process of the location, type and size of the defects found on the fabric surface. Traditional fabric inspections are usually performed by manual visual methods, which are low in efficiency and poor in precision for long-term industrial. Lack of concentration, human fatigue, and time consumption are the main drawbacks associated with the manual fabric defect detection process. Applications based on computer vision and digital image processing can address the abovementioned limitations and drawbacks. Here I have used machine learning and deep learning approach to identify/categorize defects.
